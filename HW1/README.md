In this homework, your goal is to implement a web-based scatter plot to show the attached iris dataset by using D3. Users should be able to determine the x-axis (and y-axis) to show the values of one of the attributes, such as sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width, when interacting with the tool. Besides, please render scatter points in different colors to represent the flower classes (three in total). In this case, the attribute relations of different flowers can be further visualized.

dataset: `iris.csv`
