In this homework, you have to implement two graph visualization idioms: node-link diagram and adjacency matrix. You can implement the force-directed graph method to determine node positions in the node-link diagram. Please also classify nodes into five categories according to their neighbor numbers, and visualize the categories by using different colors. Regarding the adjacency matrix, use black and white to indicate whether the edge exists.  You don't need to worry about the node ordering at the current step. I'll show you the ordering algorithms in the later lectures. The two idioms should be arranged side by side, one on the left and one on the right, for users to discover insights. Specifically, they can interact with one of the idioms by Mouse clicking or hovering the nodes/edges. The corresponding nodes/edges on the other idiom will be highlighted for visual analysis. Overall, you will get a higher score if the interaction is more intuitive and effective.
